## 📖 Project Overview

**Arth-Neeti** ("Financial Policy" or "Wisdom") is a turn-based role-playing game where players navigate the first 12 months of their professional life.

### 🚀 Version 3.0.0: The "Market Mogul" Update
The latest release introduces a complete economic simulation, allowing players to trade stocks, manage debt, and receive AI-powered financial advice.

*   **Income & Expenses**: Managing a fixed salary against recurring bills (rent, utilities) and unexpected costs.
*   **Investment**: Real-time stock market simulation with sector-specific trends (Tech, Green Energy, Gold).
*   **Credit Logic**: A dynamic credit score system (300-900) influenced by bill payments and loan management.
*   **AI Advisory**: Integrated Google Gemini AI providing contextual financial advice for every scenario.

The project is built as a **Headless Django Monolith (API)** serving a **React Single Page Application (SPA)**.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system follows a predictable **Client-Server** architecture:

```mermaid
graph TD
    Client[React Frontend] -->|REST API (Axios)| Server[Django Backend]
    
    subgraph "Frontend Layer"
        Client --> Auth[Firebase SDK]
        Client --> State[Context Providers]
    end

    subgraph "Backend Layer"
        Server -->|Verify Token| Firebase[Firebase Admin]
        Server -->|Query| DB[(SQLite/Postgres)]
        Server -->|Prompt| Gemini[Google AI API]
        Server -->|Business Logic| GameEngine[Game Engine App]
    end
```

### Key Modules
1.  **game_engine**:
    *   `models.py`: Defines the world (ScenarioCard, GameSession, StockHistory).
    *   `advisor.py`: Encapsulates the AI logic (Gemini + Rules).
    *   `firebase_auth.py`: Middleware for verifying Identity Tokens.
2.  **frontend/src/components**:
    *   `ScenarioCard.jsx`: Main interaction UI.
    *   `StockTicker.jsx`: Investment dashboard.
    *   `GameOverScreen.jsx`: Analytics and Reporting.

## ⚠️ Limitations & Known Gaps

*   **Leaderboard Visibility**: The leaderboard is currently only accessible via the *Game Over* screen, not from the main dashboard.
*   **Styling System**: The project uses component-specific CSS files (`.css`). There is no global utility framework (like Tailwind), making global style changes slower.
*   **Mobile Responsiveness**: While playable on mobile, complex dashboards (Stock Market/Reports) are optimized for Desktop.
*   **Test Coverage**: Basic tests exist in `tests.py`, but comprehensive unit testing for React components is missing.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

Based on the current architecture, these extensions are viable:
1.  **Persistent Leaderboard Page**: Expose the `api.getLeaderboard()` endpoint to a new `/leaderboard` frontend route.
2.  **Multi-Language Content**: Fully populate the `title_hi` and `description_hi` fields in the database for complete Hindi support.
3.  **Real-Time Stock Updates**: Replace the per-turn stock update with a WebSocket connection (using Django Channels) for "live" ticker feels.
4.  **Social Features**: Share "Financial Persona" directly to social media using the `ProfileScreen` data.
